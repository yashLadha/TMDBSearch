This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a movie serach website, that searches for the list of movies from a user defined query
It shows a list of possible matches. User can also view the information of the movies as well.

There is no backend for the website and all the things are handled by Redux + Fetch.

Deployment URL :

`.env` file is pushed because i am too tired to set it in config vars in deployment (Naa time issue ).
